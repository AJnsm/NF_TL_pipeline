Doublets:
expected_doublet_rate (0.076 for 10k lib size), min_counts, min_cells, min_gene_variability_pctl, n_princ_comps

QC:
min_genes, min_cells, percent Mito, counts_per_cell_after, min_mean, max_mean, min_disp

HVG:
target_sum, min_mean, max_mean(should just be very large), min_disp, nGenes (was always 500)
NOTE: I think this doesn't matter so much anymore, since we're not using it for clustering etc. As long as we get more than nGenes highly variable genes, we're picking the top anyway, and the ordering will stay the same. I think.

Cell selection:
How many cells to select per disjoint data set.
